## How to start

- This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app)

- In the project directory run `yarn` to install dependencies, and after that, you can use
  `yarn start`
  to run the app in the development mode.

- Also, you can use the `yarn test` script to run tests of the project.

- The page will reload if you make edits.
  You will also see any lint errors in the console.
  Other scripts are the same as `create-react-app` documentation.
